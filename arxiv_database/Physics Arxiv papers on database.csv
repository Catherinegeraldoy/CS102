Sohoni, Melissa Bosch, Ryotatsu Yanagimoto, Marc Jankowski, Timothy P. McKenna, Tianyu Wang, Gennady Shvets, Maxim R. Shcherbakov, Logan ","Optics (physics.optics)","On-chip photonic processors for neural networks have potential benefits in both speed and energy efficiency but have not yet reached the scale at which they can outperform electronic processors. The dominant paradigm for designing on-chip photonics is to make networks of relatively bulky discrete components connected by one-dimensional waveguides. A far more compact alternative is to avoid explicitly defining any components and instead sculpt the continuous substrate of the photonic processor to directly perform the computation using waves freely propagating in two dimensions. We propose and demonstrate a device whose refractive index as a function of space, $n(x,z)$, can be rapidly reprogrammed, allowing arbitrary control over the wave propagation in the device. Our device, a 2D-programmable waveguide, combines photoconductive gain with the electro-optic effect to achieve massively parallel modulation of the refractive index of a slab waveguide, with an index modulation depth of $10^{-3}$ and approximately $10^4$ programmable degrees of freedom. We used a prototype device with a functional area of $12,	ext{mm}^2$ to perform neural-network inference with up to 49-dimensional input vectors in a single pass, achieving 96% accuracy on vowel classification and 86% accuracy on $7 	imes 7$-pixel MNIST handwritten-digit classification. This is a scale beyond that of previous photonic chips relying on discrete components, illustrating the benefit of the continuous-waves paradigm. In principle, with large enough chip area, the reprogrammability of the device's refractive index distribution enables the reconfigurable realization of any passive, linear photonic circuit or device. This promises the development of more compact and versatile photonic systems for a wide range of applications, including optical processing, smart sensing, spectroscopy, and optical communications.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:37:22 UTC (25,256 KB)"
"2",2,"LoDIP: Low light phase retrieval with deep image prior","Raunak Manekar, Elisa Negrini, Minh Pham, Daniel Jacobs, Jaideep Srivastava","Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)","Phase retrieval (PR) is a fundamental challenge in scientific imaging, enabling nanoscale techniques like coherent diffractive imaging (CDI). Imaging at low radiation doses becomes important in applications where samples are susceptible to radiation damage. However, most PR methods struggle in low dose scenario due to the presence of very high shot noise. Advancements in the optical data acquisition setup, exemplified by in-situ CDI, have shown potential for low-dose imaging. But these depend on a time series of measurements, rendering them unsuitable for single-image applications. Similarly, on the computational front, data-driven phase retrieval techniques are not readily adaptable to the single-image context. Deep learning based single-image methods, such as deep image prior, have been effective for various imaging tasks but have exhibited limited success when applied to PR. In this work, we propose LoDIP which combines the in-situ CDI setup with the power of implicit neural priors to tackle the problem of single-image low-dose phase retrieval. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of LoDIP on this task as well as applicability to real experimental scenarios.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:29:07 UTC (7,846 KB)"
"3",3,"Approaching Periodic Systems in Ensemble Density Functional Theory 	extit{via} Finite One-Dimensional Models","Remi J. Leano, Aurora Pribram-Jones, David A. Strubbe","Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)","Ensemble Density Functional Theory (EDFT) is a generalization of ground-state Density Functional Theory (GS DFT), which is based on an exact formal theory of finite collections of a system's ground and excited states. EDFT in various forms has been shown to improve the accuracy of calculated energy level differences in isolated model systems, atoms, and molecules, but it is not yet clear how EDFT could be used to calculate band gaps for periodic systems. We extend the application of EDFT toward periodic systems by estimating the thermodynamic limit with increasingly large finite one-dimensional enquote{particle in a box} systems, which approach the uniform electron gas. Using ensemble-generalized Hartree and Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA) exchange-correlation functionals, we find that corrections go to zero in the infinite limit, as expected for a metallic system. However, there is a correction to the effective mass, as estimated from bi- and tri-ensembles, indicating promise for non-trivial results for EDFT on periodic systems. Singlet excitation energies are found to be positive, but triplet excitation energies are sometimes negative (a triplet instability), pointing to deficiencies of the approximations.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:21:42 UTC (1,713 KB)"

Javaloyes","Optics (physics.optics)","We demonstrate the existence of a multiplicity of co-existing frequency combs in a harmonically mode-locked laser that we link to the splay phases of the Kuramoto model with short range interactions. These splay states are multistable and the laser may wander between them under the influence of stochastic forces. Consequently, the many pulses circulating in the cavity are not necessarily coherent with each other. We show that this partially disordered state for the phase of the optical field features regular train of pulses in the field intensity, a state that we term an incoherent crystal of optical pulses. We provide evidence that the notion of coherence should be interpreted by comparing the duration of the measurement time with the Kramers' escape time of each splay state. Our results are confirmed experimentally by studying a passively mode-locked vertical external-cavity surface-emitting laser.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:18:56 UTC (3,487 KB)"

Singh","Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)","AeAFe4As4 (Ae = Ca, A = K; 1144) having a transition temperature of 35 K is a stoichiometric family of iron-based superconductors (FBS). Here, we present a detailed study of a high-pressure synthesis of CaKFe4As4 bulks to investigate the impact of these conditions on the superconducting properties of the 1144 family. Additionally, these samples are also prepared by conventional synthesis method at ambient pressure (CSP) and studied the influence of impurities on the superconducting properties of CaKFe4As4. Structural, microstructural, transport and magnetization measurements have been performed to reach the final conclusions. Interestingly, the high-pressure synthesis of the parent CaKFe4As4 compound enhances the transition temperature (Tc) by 2 K and the critical current density (Jc) by one order of magnitude in the whole magnetic field range of 9 T than that of the 1144 bulks prepared by CSP. It suggests the improvement of the pinning centers and grain connections by the high-pressure synthesis approach. Interestingly, our results depict the superconducting onset transition temperature (Tconset) of this stoichiometric 1144 family is robust with the presence of the common 122 (CaFe2As2 or KFe2As2) impurity phases, which is a different behavior compared to other FBS families. However, these impurity phases reduce the grain connections and lead to the phase separation during the formation of the superconducting (1144) phase.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:05:51 UTC (17,351 KB)"
"6",6,"Computation of the expectation value of the spin operator $hat{S}^2$ for the Spin-Flip Bethe-Salpeter Equation","Bradford A. Barker, Arabi Seshappan, David A. Strubbe","Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)","Spin-flip methods applied to excited-state approaches like the Bethe-Salpeter Equation allow access to the excitation energies of open-shell systems, such as molecules and defects in solids. The eigenstates of these solutions, however, are generally not eigenstates of the spin operator $hat{S}^2$. Even for simple cases where the excitation vector is expected to be, for example, a triplet state, the value of $langle hat{S}^2 angle$ may be found to differ from 2.00; this difference is called ``spin contamination.'' The expectation values $langle hat{S}^2 angle$ must be computed for each excitation vector, to assist with the characterization of the particular excitation and to determine the amount of spin contamination of the state. Our aim is to provide for the first time in the spin-flip methods literature a comprehensive resource on the derivation of the formulas for $langle hat{S}^2 angle$ as well as its computational implementation. After a brief discussion of the theory of the Spin-Flip Bethe-Salpeter Equation and some examples further illustrating the need for calculating $langle hat{S}^2 angle$, we present the derivation for the general equation for computing $langle hat{S}^2 angle$ with the eigenvectors from an SF-BSE calculation, how it is implemented in a Python script, and timing information on how this calculation scales with the size of the SF-BSE Hamiltonian.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 17:55:26 UTC (508 KB)"
"7",7,"Cluster Scanning: a novel approach to resonance searches","Ivan Oleksiyuk, John Andrew Raine, Michael Krämer, Svyatoslav Voloshynovskiy, Tobias Golling","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)","We propose a new model-independent method for new physics searches called Cluster Scanning. It uses the k-means algorithm to perform clustering in the space of low-level event or jet observables, and separates potentially anomalous clusters to construct a signal-enriched region. The invariant mass spectra in these two regions are then used to determine whether a resonant signal is present. A pseudo-analysis on the LHC Olympics dataset with a $Z'$ resonance shows that Cluster Scanning outperforms the widely used 4-parameter functional background fitting procedures, reducing the number of signal events needed to reach a $3sigma$ significant access by a factor of 0.61. Emphasis is placed on the speed of the method, which allows the test statistic to be calibrated on synthetic data.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 17:49:23 UTC (1,178 KB)"
"8",8,"Novel spectral methods for shock capturing and the removal of tygers in computational fluid dynamics","Venkata Sai Swetha Kolluru, Nicolas Besse, Rahul Pandit","Numerical Analysis (math.NA)","Spectral methods yield numerical solutions of the Galerkin-truncated versions of nonlinear partial differential equations involved especially in fluid dynamics. In the presence of discontinuities, such as shocks, spectral approximations develop Gibbs oscillations near the discontinuity. This causes the numerical solution to deviate quickly from the true solution. For spectral approximations of the 1D inviscid Burgers equation, nonlinear wave resonances lead to the formation of tygers in well-resolved areas of the flow, far from the shock. Recently, Besse(to be published) has proposed novel spectral relaxation (SR) and spectral purging (SP) schemes for the removal of tygers and Gibbs oscillations in spectral approximations of nonlinear conservation laws. For the 1D inviscid Burgers equation, it is shown that the novel SR and SP approximations of the solution converge strongly in L2 norm to the entropic weak solution, under an appropriate choice of kernels and related parameters. In this work, we carry out a detailed numerical investigation of SR and SP schemes when applied to the 1D inviscid Burgers equation and report the efficiency of shock capture and the removal of tygers. We then extend our study to systems of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws - such as the 2x2 system of the shallow water equations and the standard 3x3 system of 1D compressible Euler equations. For the latter, we generalise the implementation of SR methods to non-periodic problems using Chebyshev polynomials. We then turn to singular flow in the 1D wall approximation of the 3D-axisymmetric wall-bounded incompressible Euler equation. Here, in order to determine the blowup time of the solution, we compare the decay of the width of the analyticity strip, obtained from the pure pseudospectral method, with the improved estimate obtained using the novel spectral relaxation scheme.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 17:05:06 UTC (15,800 KB)"
"9",9,"Outlier-Detection for Reactive Machine Learned Potential Energy Surfaces","Luis Itza Vazquez-Salazar, Silvan Käser, Markus Meuwly","Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)","Uncertainty quantification (UQ) to detect samples with large expected errors (outliers) is applied to reactive molecular potential energy surfaces (PESs). Three methods - Ensembles, Deep Evidential Regression (DER), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) - were applied to the H-transfer reaction between ${it syn-}$Criegee and vinyl hydroxyperoxide. The results indicate that ensemble models provide the best results for detecting outliers, followed by GMM. For example, from a pool of 1000 structures with the largest uncertainty, the detection quality for outliers is $sim 90$ % and $sim 50$ %, respectively, if 25 or 1000 structures with large errors are sought. On the contrary, the limitations of the statistical assumptions of DER greatly impacted its prediction capabilities. Finally, a structure-based indicator was found to be correlated with large average error, which may help to rapidly classify new structures into those that provide an advantage for refining the neural network.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 17:01:21 UTC (5,252 KB)"

Here we use attosecond soft-X-ray pulses from LCLS to probe element-specific core-level photoionization delays between N-1s and C-1s core shells of aromatic azabenzene molecules containing one to three nitrogen atoms. Using a self-referenced technique, we measure absolute N-1s photoionization delays of up to 300 as, which increase with the number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. Comparisons to molecular photoionization calculations reveal the dominant mechanisms to be the increasing trapping of the photoelectron wavefunction in the molecular plane, as well as the symmetry-induced decrease of the coupling strength among the partial waves. This study demonstrates the unique opportunities opened by measurements of core-level photoionization delays for unravelling attosecond electronic dynamics in the building blocks of biomolecules and molecular optoelectronics.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 16:59:00 UTC (41,485 KB)"

A positive feedback between the asymmetry of the acto-myosin cortex density and cell motion gives rise to a spontaneous symmetry breaking beyond a threshold contractility that depends on the resistance of extracellular medium. In highly viscous environments, we predict bistability under moderate contractility, so that symmetry breaking needs to be activated. In a viscoelastic environment, we find periodic oscillations in cortex density and velocity polarization. At the boundary between viscous and viscoelastic environments, the cell may either cross into the viscoelastic medium, bounce back into the viscous medium, or become trapped at the boundary. The different scenarios defined different phase diagram that are confirmed by numerical simulations.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 16:42:59 UTC (1,170 KB)"

The evolution of TorchMD-Net into a more comprehensive and versatile framework is highlighted, incorporating cutting-edge architectures such as TensorNet. This transformation is achieved through a modular design approach, encouraging customized applications within the scientific community. The most notable enhancement is a significant improvement in computational efficiency, achieving a very remarkable acceleration in the computation of energy and forces for TensorNet models, with performance gains ranging from 2-fold to 10-fold over previous iterations. Other enhancements include highly optimized neighbor search algorithms that support periodic boundary conditions and the smooth integration with existing molecular dynamics frameworks. Additionally, the updated version introduces the capability to integrate physical priors, further enriching its application spectrum and utility in research.

The eigenfrequency sensitivities near an exceptional point are significantly enhanced, whereby they diverge directly at the exceptional point. Capturing this enhanced sensitivity is crucial for the investigation and optimization of exceptional-point-based applications, such as optical sensors. We present a numerical framework, based on contour integration and algorithmic differentiation, to accurately and efficiently compute eigenfrequency sensitivities near exceptional points. We demonstrate the framework to an optical microdisk cavity and derive a semi-analytical solution to validate the numerical results. The computed eigenfrequency sensitivities are used to track the exceptional point along an exceptional surface in the parameter space. The presented framework can be applied to any kind of resonance problem, e.g., with arbitrary geometry or with exceptional points of arbitrary order.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 16:18:40 UTC (1,156 KB)"

An example calculation is shown using the Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX) equilibrium, demonstrating the method's use in coil design and understanding the limits of the access properties of coil sets. Current potential patches have additional desirable properties such as of promoting sparse current sheet solutions and identifying crucial locations of shaping current placement. A result is found for the HSX equilibrium that shaping currents covering only 25% of the winding surface is sufficient to produce the equilibrium to a good accuracy.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 16:00:21 UTC (24,191 KB)"

However, most of these quantum sources work at low carrier density region, where the Shockley-Read-Hall recombination may dominant and seriously reduce the emission efficiency. In order to diminish the affection of carrier trapping and sustain a strong photoluminescence emission under low power pumping condition, we investigated on the influence of Suspending to monolayered tungsten diselenide, novel two-dimensional quantum material. Not only the PL intensity, but also the fundamental photoluminescence quantum yield has exhibited a huge, order-scale enhancement through suspending, even surprisingly, we found the PLQY improvement revealed far significantly under small pumping power and came out an exponential increase tendency toward even lower carrier density region. With its strong excitonic effect, suspended WSe_2 offers a solution to reduce carrier trapping and participate in non-radiative processes. Moreover, in the low-power range where SRH recombination dominates, suspended WSe_2 exhibited remarkably higher percentage of excitonic radiation compared to contacted WSe_2. Herein, we quantitatively demonstrate the significance of suspended WSe_2 monolayer at low carrier density region, highlighting its potential for developing compact, low-power quantum emitters in the future.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 15:29:31 UTC (1,767 KB)"

The ranges of parameters covered complement those considered by Lin & Donnelly (1969). The influence of the jet curvature is clarified. A model based on the viscous stress acting on the interface proves to be in good agreement with the experiments in the limit of very viscous liquids. For less viscous liquids, the critical capillary number happens to be mainly controlled by the ratio of the dynamic viscosity of the air and of the liquid. Besides, the observed evolution of the critical capillary number agrees with the mechanism suggested by Eggers (2001) that is based on the cusp dynamic.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 15:09:06 UTC (459 KB)"

For entangled two photon absorption in particular, very high photon flux combined with high time-frequency entanglement is crucial for observing a signal. So far these conditions could be met by using high power lasers driving degenerate, type 0 bulk-crystal spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources. This naturally limits the available wavelength ranges and precludes deterministic splitting of the generated output photons.

Eng","Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)","Ferroelectric domain wall conductivity (DWC) is an intriguing functional property, that can be controlled through external stimuli such as electric and mechanical fields. Optical-field control, as a non-invasive flexible handle, has rarely been applied so far, but significantly expands the possibility for both tuning and probing DWC. On the one hand, as known from Second-Harmonic, Raman, and CARS micro-spectroscopy, the optical in-and-out approach delivers parameters on the DW distribution, the DW inclination, and probes the DW vibrational modes; on the other hand, photons might be applied also to directly generate charge carriers within the DW, hence acting as a functional and spectrally tunable probe to deduce the integral or local absorption properties and bandgaps of conductive DWs. Here, we report on such an optoelectronic approach by investigating the photo-induced DWC (PI-DWC) in DWs of the model system lithium niobate, a material that is well known for hosting conductive DWs. We compare three different crystals containing different numbers of domain walls: (A) none, (B) one, and (C) many conductive DWs. All samples are inspected for their current-voltage (I-V) behavior (i) in darkness, and (ii) for different illumination wavelengths swept from 500 nm down to 310 nm. All samples show their maximum PI-DWC at 310 nm, i.e., at the optical bandgap of lithium niobate; moreover, sample (C) reaches PI-DWCs of several $mu$A. Interestingly, a noticeable PI-DWC is also observed for sub-bandgap illumination, i.e., wavelengths as high as 500 nm, hinting towards the existence and decisive role of electronic in-gap states that contribute to the electronic transport along DWs. Finally, conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) investigations under illumination proved that the PI-DWC is confined to the DW area, and does not originate from photo-induced bulk conductivity.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 13:47:52 UTC (2,184 KB)"

Our method uses adversarial autoencoders, which reduce the dimensionality of the full order model to a set of latent variables that are enforced to match a prior, for example a normal distribution. Adversarial autoencoders are seen as generative models, and they can be trained to generate high-resolution samples from low-resoution inputs, meaning they can address the so-called super-resolution problem. Then, a second neural network is trained to learn the physical structure of the latent variables and predict their temporal evolution. This neural network is known as an structure-preserving neural network. It learns the metriplectic-structure of the system and applies a physical bias to ensure that the first and second principles of thermodynamics are fulfilled. The integrated trajectories are decoded to their original dimensionality, as well as to the higher dimensionality space produced by the adversarial autoencoder and they are compared to the ground truth solution. The method is tested with two examples of flow over a cylinder, where the fluid properties are varied between both examples.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 13:46:45 UTC (3,624 KB)"

We present the first three-dimensional potential energy surface (3D-PES) for the CH$_3$CCH-He molecular complex, study the dynamics of the collision, and report the first set of rate coefficients for temperatures up to 100 K for the collisional excitation of the lowest 60 ortho rotational levels and 60 para rotational levels of CH$_3$CCH by He atoms. We computed the 3D-PES with the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster with single-, double-, and perturbative triple-excitation method, in conjunction with the augmented correlation-consistent triple zeta basis set (CCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ). The 3D-PES was fitted to an analytical function. Scattering computations of pure rotational (de-)excitation of CH$_3$CCH by collision with He atoms were performed and the state-to-state cross sections were computed using the close coupling method for total energies up to 100 cm$^{-1}$ and with the coupled states approximation at higher energy for both ortho and para symmetries of CH$_3$CCH. The PES obtained is caracterized by a large anisotropy and a potential well depth of 51.04 cm$^{-1}$. By thermally averaging the collisional cross sections, we determined quenching rate coefficients for kinetic temperatures up to 100 K. A strong even $Delta j$ propensity rule at almost all collision energies exists for CH$_3$CCH-He complex. To evaluate the impact of rate coefficients in the analysis of observations, we carried out non-LTE radiative transfer computations of the excitation temperatures and we demonstrate that LTE conditions are typically not fulfilled for the propyne molecule.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 13:17:19 UTC (550 KB)"

Starting with one of the GS, we excite the system by supplying it with an excess energy DK located initially on one of the dipoles. We study the time evolution of the array for different values of the system parameters b and DK. Our focus is hereby on two features of the energy propagation: the redistribution of the excess energy DK among the two chains and the energy localization along each chain. For typical parameter values, the array of dipoles reaches both the equipartition between the chains and the thermal equilibrium from the early stages of the time evolution. Nevertheless, there is a region in parameter space (b,DK) where even up to the long computation time of this study, the array does neither reach energy equipartition nor thermalization between chains. This fact is due to the existence of persistent chaotic breathers.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 12:53:02 UTC (5,670 KB)"

The cavities were treated at temperature 120 - 165 C for an extended period of time (24 - 48 hours) either in high vacuum or in a low partial pressure of ultra-pure nitrogen. The improvement in Q0 with a Q-rise was observed when nitrogen gas was injected at 300 C during the cavity cooldown from 800 C and held at 165 C, without any degradation in accelerating gradient over the baseline performance. The treatment was applied to several elliptical cavities with frequency ranging from 0.75 GHz to 3.0 GHz, showing an improved quality factor as a result of low temperature nitrogen treatments. The Q-rise feature is similar to that achieved by nitrogen alloying Nb cavities at higher temperature, followed by material removal by electropolishing. The surface modification was confirmed by the change in electronic mean free path and tuned with the temperature and duration of heat treatment. The decrease of the temperature-dependent surface resistance with increasing RF field, resulting in a Q-rise, becomes stronger with increasing frequency and decreasing temperature. The data suggest a crossover frequency of 0.95 GHz above which the Q-rise phenomenon occurs at 2 K. Some of these results can be explained qualitatively with an existing model which calculates the intrinsic field dependence of the surface resistance, considering both equilibrium and nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution functions.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 12:29:56 UTC (8,993 KB)"

Dekker, Detlef Lohse","Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)","The evaporation of water/1,2-hexanediol binary drops shows remarkable segregation dynamics, with hexanediol-rich spots forming at the rim, thus breaking axisymmetry. While the segregation of hexanediol near the rim can be attributed to the preferential evaporation of water, the symmetry-breaking and spot formation could not yet be successfully explained. With three-dimensional simulations and azimuthal stability analysis of a minimal model, we investigate the flow and composition in the drop. We show that a slightly non-monotonic surface tension causes the emergence of a counter-rotating Marangoni vortex in the hexanediol-rich rim region, which subsequently becomes azimuthally unstable and forms the observed spots. Accurate measurements reveal that the surface tension is indeed non-monotonic (~0.3 mN/m). This work provides valuable insight for applications like inkjet printing or spray cooling.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 12:15:40 UTC (6,691 KB)"

In magnetic materials, skyrmions are localized spin textures that exhibit unique stability and mobility properties, making them highly relevant to the burgeoning field of spintronics. In optics, these structures open new frontiers in manipulating and controlling light at the nanoscale. The convergence of optics and magnetics holds therefore immense potential for manipulating magnetic processes at ultrafast timescales. Here, we explore the possibility of generating skyrmionic topological structures within the magnetic field induced by the inverse Faraday effect in a plasmonic nanostructure. Our investigation reveals that a gold nanoring, featuring a dark mode, can generate counter-propagating photocurrents between its inner and outer segments, thereby enabling the magnetization of gold and supporting a skyrmionic vectorial distribution. We elucidate that these photocurrents arise from the localized control of light polarization, facilitating their counter-propagative motion. The generation of skyrmions through the inverse Faraday effect at the nanoscale presents a pathway towards directly integrating this topology into magnetic layers. This advancement holds promise for ultrafast timescales, offering direct applications in ultrafast data writing and processing.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 11:35:47 UTC (8,014 KB)"

Jakob, Moritz Zaiss, Martin Blaimer","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Purpose: To develop an image space formalism of multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for Fourier domain interpolation in MRI reconstructions and analytically estimate noise propagation during CNN inference. Theory and Methods: Nonlinear activations in the Fourier domain (also known as k-space) using complex-valued Rectifier Linear Units are expressed as elementwise multiplication with activation masks. This operation is transformed into a convolution in the image space. After network training in k-space, this approach provides an algebraic expression for the derivative of the reconstructed image with respect to the aliased coil images, which serve as the input tensors to the network in the image space. This allows the variance in the network inference to be estimated analytically and to be used to describe noise characteristics. Monte-Carlo simulations and numerical approaches based on auto-differentiation were used for validation. The framework was tested on retrospectively undersampled invivo brain images. Results: Inferences conducted in the image domain are quasi-identical to inferences in the k-space, underlined by corresponding quantitative metrics. Noise variance maps obtained from the analytical expression correspond with those obtained via Monte-Carlo simulations, as well as via an auto-differentiation approach. The noise resilience is well characterized, as in the case of classical Parallel Imaging. Komolgorov-Smirnov tests demonstrate Gaussian distributions of voxel magnitudes in variance maps obtained via Monte-Carlo simulations. Conclusion: The quasi-equivalent image space formalism for neural networks for k-space interpolation enables fast and accurate description of the noise characteristics during CNN inference, analogous to geometry-factor maps in traditional parallel imaging methods.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 11:01:58 UTC (1,871 KB)"

The dominant paradigm for designing on-chip photonics is to make networks of relatively bulky discrete components connected by one-dimensional waveguides. A far more compact alternative is to avoid explicitly defining any components and instead sculpt the continuous substrate of the photonic processor to directly perform the computation using waves freely propagating in two dimensions. We propose and demonstrate a device whose refractive index as a function of space, $n(x,z)$, can be rapidly reprogrammed, allowing arbitrary control over the wave propagation in the device. Our device, a 2D-programmable waveguide, combines photoconductive gain with the electro-optic effect to achieve massively parallel modulation of the refractive index of a slab waveguide, with an index modulation depth of $10^{-3}$ and approximately $10^4$ programmable degrees of freedom. We used a prototype device with a functional area of $12,	ext{mm}^2$ to perform neural-network inference with up to 49-dimensional input vectors in a single pass, achieving 96% accuracy on vowel classification and 86% accuracy on $7 	imes 7$-pixel MNIST handwritten-digit classification. This is a scale beyond that of previous photonic chips relying on discrete components, illustrating the benefit of the continuous-waves paradigm. In principle, with large enough chip area, the reprogrammability of the device's refractive index distribution enables the reconfigurable realization of any passive, linear photonic circuit or device. This promises the development of more compact and versatile photonic systems for a wide range of applications, including optical processing, smart sensing, spectroscopy, and optical communications.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:37:22 UTC (25,256 KB)"

Imaging at low radiation doses becomes important in applications where samples are susceptible to radiation damage. However, most PR methods struggle in low dose scenario due to the presence of very high shot noise. Advancements in the optical data acquisition setup, exemplified by in-situ CDI, have shown potential for low-dose imaging. But these depend on a time series of measurements, rendering them unsuitable for single-image applications. Similarly, on the computational front, data-driven phase retrieval techniques are not readily adaptable to the single-image context. Deep learning based single-image methods, such as deep image prior, have been effective for various imaging tasks but have exhibited limited success when applied to PR. In this work, we propose LoDIP which combines the in-situ CDI setup with the power of implicit neural priors to tackle the problem of single-image low-dose phase retrieval. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of LoDIP on this task as well as applicability to real experimental scenarios.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:29:07 UTC (7,846 KB)"

We show that this partially disordered state for the phase of the optical field features regular train of pulses in the field intensity, a state that we term an incoherent crystal of optical pulses. We provide evidence that the notion of coherence should be interpreted by comparing the duration of the measurement time with the Kramers' escape time of each splay state.

Even for simple cases where the excitation vector is expected to be, for example, a triplet state, the value of $langle hat{S}^2 angle$ may be found to differ from 2.00; this difference is called ``spin contamination.''

In the presence of discontinuities, such as shocks, spectral approximations develop Gibbs oscillations near the discontinuity. This causes the numerical solution to deviate quickly from the true solution. For spectral approximations of the 1D inviscid Burgers equation, nonlinear wave resonances lead to the formation of tygers in well-resolved areas of the flow, far from the shock. Recently, Besse(to be published) has proposed novel spectral relaxation (SR) and spectral purging (SP) schemes for the removal of tygers and Gibbs oscillations in spectral approximations of nonlinear conservation laws. For the 1D inviscid Burgers equation, it is shown that the novel SR and SP approximations of the solution converge strongly in L2 norm to the entropic weak solution, under an appropriate choice of kernels and related parameters. In this work, we carry out a detailed numerical investigation of SR and SP schemes when applied to the 1D inviscid Burgers equation and report the efficiency of shock capture and the removal of tygers. We then extend our study to systems of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws - such as the 2x2 system of the shallow water equations and the standard 3x3 system of 1D compressible Euler equations. For the latter, we generalise the implementation of SR methods to non-periodic problems using Chebyshev polynomials. We then turn to singular flow in the 1D wall approximation of the 3D-axisymmetric wall-bounded incompressible Euler equation. Here, in order to determine the blowup time of the solution, we compare the decay of the width of the analyticity strip, obtained from the pure pseudospectral method, with the improved estimate obtained using the novel spectral relaxation scheme.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 17:05:06 UTC (15,800 KB)"

Optical-field control, as a non-invasive flexible handle, has rarely been applied so far, but significantly expands the possibility for both tuning and probing DWC. On the one hand, as known from Second-Harmonic, Raman, and CARS micro-spectroscopy, the optical in-and-out approach delivers parameters on the DW distribution, the DW inclination, and probes the DW vibrational modes; on the other hand, photons might be applied also to directly generate charge carriers within the DW, hence acting as a functional and spectrally tunable probe to deduce the integral or local absorption properties and bandgaps of conductive DWs. Here, we report on such an optoelectronic approach by investigating the photo-induced DWC (PI-DWC) in DWs of the model system lithium niobate, a material that is well known for hosting conductive DWs. We compare three different crystals containing different numbers of domain walls: (A) none, (B) one, and (C) many conductive DWs. All samples are inspected for their current-voltage (I-V) behavior (i) in darkness, and (ii) for different illumination wavelengths swept from 500 nm down to 310 nm. All samples show their maximum PI-DWC at 310 nm, i.e., at the optical bandgap of lithium niobate; moreover, sample (C) reaches PI-DWCs of several $mu$A. Interestingly, a noticeable PI-DWC is also observed for sub-bandgap illumination, i.e., wavelengths as high as 500 nm, hinting towards the existence and decisive role of electronic in-gap states that contribute to the electronic transport along DWs. Finally, conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) investigations under illumination proved that the PI-DWC is confined to the DW area, and does not originate from photo-induced bulk conductivity.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 13:47:52 UTC (2,184 KB)"

We computed the 3D-PES with the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster with single-, double-, and perturbative triple-excitation method, in conjunction with the augmented correlation-consistent triple zeta basis set (CCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ). The 3D-PES was fitted to an analytical function. Scattering computations of pure rotational (de-)excitation of CH$_3$CCH by collision with He atoms were performed and the state-to-state cross sections were computed using the close coupling method for total energies up to 100 cm$^{-1}$ and with the coupled states approximation at higher energy for both ortho and para symmetries of CH$_3$CCH. The PES obtained is caracterized by a large anisotropy and a potential well depth of 51.04 cm$^{-1}$. By thermally averaging the collisional cross sections, we determined quenching rate coefficients for kinetic temperatures up to 100 K. A strong even $Delta j$ propensity rule at almost all collision energies exists for CH$_3$CCH-He complex. To evaluate the impact of rate coefficients in the analysis of observations, we carried out non-LTE radiative transfer computations of the excitation temperatures and we demonstrate that LTE conditions are typically not fulfilled for the propyne molecule.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 13:17:19 UTC (550 KB)"

A crossover between two different ground state (GS) equilibrium configurations is observed with varying distance between the two chains of the array. Linearizing around the GS configurations, we verify that interactions up to third nearest neighbors should be accounted for accurately describe the resulting dynamics. Starting with one of the GS, we excite the system by supplying it with an excess energy DK located initially on one of the dipoles. We study the time evolution of the array for different values of the system parameters b and DK. Our focus is hereby on two features of the energy propagation: the redistribution of the excess energy DK among the two chains and the energy localization along each chain. For typical parameter values, the array of dipoles reaches both the equipartition between the chains and the thermal equilibrium from the early stages of the time evolution. Nevertheless, there is a region in parameter space (b,DK) where even up to the long computation time of this study, the array does neither reach energy equipartition nor thermalization between chains. This fact is due to the existence of persistent chaotic breathers.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 12:53:02 UTC (5,670 KB)"

Ciovati","Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)","We report the RF performance of several single-cell superconducting radio-frequency cavities subjected to low temperature heat treatment in nitrogen environment. The cavities were treated at temperature 120 - 165 C for an extended period of time (24 - 48 hours) either in high vacuum or in a low partial pressure of ultra-pure nitrogen. The improvement in Q0 with a Q-rise was observed when nitrogen gas was injected at 300 C during the cavity cooldown from 800 C and held at 165 C, without any degradation in accelerating gradient over the baseline performance. The treatment was applied to several elliptical cavities with frequency ranging from 0.75 GHz to 3.0 GHz, showing an improved quality factor as a result of low temperature nitrogen treatments. The Q-rise feature is similar to that achieved by nitrogen alloying Nb cavities at higher temperature, followed by material removal by electropolishing. The surface modification was confirmed by the change in electronic mean free path and tuned with the temperature and duration of heat treatment. The decrease of the temperature-dependent surface resistance with increasing RF field, resulting in a Q-rise, becomes stronger with increasing frequency and decreasing temperature. The data suggest a crossover frequency of 0.95 GHz above which the Q-rise phenomenon occurs at 2 K. Some of these results can be explained qualitatively with an existing model which calculates the intrinsic field dependence of the surface resistance, considering both equilibrium and nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution functions.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 12:29:56 UTC (8,993 KB)"

We specifically examine MedSAM, a version of SAM fine-tuned with large-scale public medical images. Despite its progress, the integration of multi-modality images (CT, PET, MRI) for effective GTV delineation remains a challenge. Focusing on SAM's application in HNC GTV segmentation, we assess its performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned scenarios using single (CT-only) and fused multi-modality images. Our study demonstrates that fine-tuning SAM significantly enhances its segmentation accuracy, building upon the already effective zero-shot results achieved with bounding box prompts.

Dekker, Detlef Lohse","Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)","The evaporation of water/1,2-hexanediol binary drops shows remarkable segregation dynamics, with hexanediol-rich spots forming at the rim, thus breaking axisymmetry. While the segregation of hexanediol near the rim can be attributed to the preferential evaporation of water, the symmetry-breaking and spot formation could not yet be successfully explained. With three-dimensional simulations and azimuthal stability analysis of a minimal model, we investigate the flow and composition in the drop. We show that a slightly non-monotonic surface tension causes the emergence of a counter-rotating Marangoni vortex in the hexanediol-rich rim region, which subsequently becomes azimuthally unstable and forms the observed spots. Accurate measurements reveal that the surface tension is indeed non-monotonic (~0.3 mN/m).

In magnetic materials, skyrmions are localized spin textures that exhibit unique stability and mobility properties, making them highly relevant to the burgeoning field of spintronics. In optics, these structures open new frontiers in manipulating and controlling light at the nanoscale. The convergence of optics and magnetics holds therefore immense potential for manipulating magnetic processes at ultrafast timescales. Here, we explore the possibility of generating skyrmionic topological structures within the magnetic field induced by the inverse Faraday effect in a plasmonic nanostructure. Our investigation reveals that a gold nanoring, featuring a dark mode, can generate counter-propagating photocurrents between its inner and outer segments, thereby enabling the magnetization of gold and supporting a skyrmionic vectorial distribution. We elucidate that these photocurrents arise from the localized control of light polarization, facilitating their counter-propagative motion. The generation of skyrmions through the inverse Faraday effect at the nanoscale presents a pathway towards directly integrating this topology into magnetic layers. This advancement holds promise for ultrafast timescales, offering direct applications in ultrafast data writing and processing.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 11:35:47 UTC (8,014 KB)"

Jakob, Moritz Zaiss, Martin Blaimer","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Purpose: To develop an image space formalism of multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for Fourier domain interpolation in MRI reconstructions and analytically estimate noise propagation during CNN inference. Theory and Methods: Nonlinear activations in the Fourier domain (also known as k-space) using complex-valued Rectifier Linear Units are expressed as elementwise multiplication with activation masks. This operation is transformed into a convolution in the image space. After network training in k-space, this approach provides an algebraic expression for the derivative of the reconstructed image with respect to the aliased coil images, which serve as the input tensors to the network in the image space. This allows the variance in the network inference to be estimated analytically and to be used to describe noise characteristics. Monte-Carlo simulations and numerical approaches based on auto-differentiation were used for validation. The framework was tested on retrospectively undersampled invivo brain images. Results: Inferences conducted in the image domain are quasi-identical to inferences in the k-space, underlined by corresponding quantitative metrics. Noise variance maps obtained from the analytical expression correspond with those obtained via Monte-Carlo simulations, as well as via an auto-differentiation approach. The noise resilience is well characterized, as in the case of classical Parallel Imaging. Komolgorov-Smirnov tests demonstrate Gaussian distributions of voxel magnitudes in variance maps obtained via Monte-Carlo simulations. Conclusion: The quasi-equivalent image space formalism for neural networks for k-space interpolation enables fast and accurate description of the noise characteristics during CNN inference, analogous to geometry-factor maps in traditional parallel imaging methods.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 11:01:58 UTC (1,871 KB)"

Considering flow past a plunging foil, MB-PINNs were trained with global physics loss relaxation and also in conjunction with a physics-based undersampling method, obtaining good accuracy. The purpose of this study was to investigate which input spatial subdomain contributes to the training under the effect of physics loss relaxation and physics-based undersampling. In the context of MB-PINNs training, three spatial zones: the moving body, wake, and outer zones were defined. To quantify which spatial zone drives the training, two novel metrics are computed from the zonal loss component gradient statistics and the proportion of sample points in each zone. Results confirm that the learning indeed depends on the combined effect of the zonal loss component gradients and the proportion of points in each zone. Moreover, the dominant input zones are also the ones that have the strongest solution gradients in some sense.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 09:27:54 UTC (3,169 KB)"

In the present work, an immersed boundary method (IBM) based in-house flow solver has been ported to the GPU using OpenACC, a compiler directive-based heterogeneous parallel programming framework.

A detailed validation study and performance analysis of the parallel solver implementations on the CPU and GPU are presented. The GPU implementation shows a speedup up to the order $O(10)$ over the CPU parallel version and up to the order $O(10^2)$ over the serial code.

Various turbulence models of Reynolds-average Navier-Stokes simulations are analyzed. A modified version of the transitional k-(v^2 )-{omega} model developed to enhance stall prediction accuracy for high-lift configurations with a nacelle chine. The vortex generator, three-element airfoil, and high-lift model are numerically simulated. The results reveal that implementing a k-(v^2 )-{omega} model with separation shear layer fixed notably enhances the stall prediction behavior for both the three-element airfoil and high-lift configuration without affecting the prediction of the vortex strength of a vortex generator. Moreover, incorporating rotation correction into the SPF k-(v^2 )-{omega} model improves the prediction of vortex strength and further enhances stall prediction for the high-lift configuration. The relative error in predicting the maximum lift coefficient is less than 5% of the experimental data. The study also investigated the impact of the nacelle chine on the stall behavior of the high-lift configuration. The results demonstrate that the chine vortex can mitigate the adverse effects of the nacelle/pylon vortex system and increase the maximum lift coefficient.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 09:09:30 UTC (3,322 KB)"

Numerical analysis based on a theoretical model revealed a bypass mechanism underlying asymmetric enzyme kinetics. In particular, we found that the origin of the asymmetric enzyme kinetics lies in the asymmetry of the allosterism, not in the asymmetry of potential shapes.

These seismic correlations could threaten science goals of planned interferometric gravitational-wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope as well as atom interferometers such as MIGA and ELGAR.

At all sites, we observe significant coherence for at least 50% of the time in the majority of the frequency region of interest. Based on the observed correlations in the seismic fields, we predict levels of correlated Newtonian noise from body waves. We project the effect of correlated Newtonian noise from body waves on the capabilities of the triangular design of the Einstein Telescope's to observe an isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) and find that, even in case of the most quiet site, its sensitivity will be affected up to $sim$20Hz. The resolvable amplitude of a GWB signal with a negatively sloped power-law behaviour would be reduced by several orders of magnitude. However, the resolvability of a power-law signal with a slope of e.g. $alpha=0$ ($alpha=2/3$) would be more moderately affected by a factor $sim$ 6-9 ($sim$3-4) in case of a low noise environment.

The electric field is treated self-consistently with ion and electron radial motion. The injection of angular momentum causes radial currents leading to charge penetration and electric field build up. The electric field varies until an equilibrium with the friction forces is reached. Both collisions with neutrals and Coulomb collisions are considered. In the case where the electric field is driven by the resonant wave, there is no collisional breakdown of the Brillouin limit [Rax et al., Phys. Plasmas 22, 092101 (2015)]; on the contrary, the maximum achievable electric field decreases when the collision frequency is increased. When two species are present, one that undergoes the wave forcing while the second does not interact with the wave, we find the following: the first species is confined, while the second species can be expelled or confined depending on the charge to mass ratio and the collisionalities. Assuming equal charge numbers, if the second species is the heavy one, it is always expelled, which is a standard result. When the second species is the light one, it can also be expelled in the common case where neutral collisions dominate over Coulomb collisions, which constitutes a new result.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 08:26:13 UTC (595 KB)"

Kinetic simulations of relativistic, charged particle beams and advanced plasma accelerator elements are often performed with high-fidelity particle-in-cell simulations, some of which fill the largest GPU supercomputers. Start-to-end modeling of a particle accelerator includes many elements and it is desirable to integrate and model advanced accelerator elements fast, in effective models. Traditionally, analytical and reduced-physics models fill this role. The vast data from high-fidelity simulations and power of GPU-accelerated computation open a new opportunity to complement traditional modeling without approximations: surrogate modeling through machine learning.

Vargas, Minglei Kang, Jatinder Saini, Jun Zhou, Peilong Wang, Wei Liu, Charles B. Simone II, Ying Xiao, Liyong Lin","Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)","A survey was designed to inquire about the practice of proton SBRT treatment for prostate cancer. The survey was distributed to all 30 proton therapy centers in the United States that participate in the National Clinical Trial Network in Feb. 2023. The survey focused on usage, patient selection criteria, prescriptions, target contours, dose constraints, treatment plan optimization and evaluation methods, patient-specific QA, and IGRT methods. Results: We received responses from 25 centers (83% participation). Only 8 respondent proton centers (32%) reported performing SBRT of the prostate. The remaining 17 centers cited three primary reasons for not offering this treatment: no clinical need, lack of volumetric imaging, and/or lack of clinical evidence. Only 1 center cited the reduction in overall reimbursement as a concern for not offering prostate SBRT. Several common practices among the 8 centers offering SBRT for the prostate were noted, such as using Hydrogel spacers, fiducial markers, and MRI for target delineation. Most proton centers (87.5%) utilized pencil beam scanning (PBS) delivery and completed Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC) phantom credentialing. Treatment planning typically used parallel opposed lateral beams, and consistent parameters for setup and range uncertainties were used for plan optimization and robustness evaluation. Measurements-based patient-specific QA, beam delivery every other day, fiducial contours for IGRT, and total doses of 35-40 GyRBE were consistent across all centers. However, there was no consensus on the risk levels for patient selection. Conclusion: Prostate SBRT is used in about 1/3 of proton centers in the US. There was a significant consistency in practices among proton centers treating with proton SBRT. It is possible that the adoption of proton SBRT may become more common if proton SBRT is more commonly offered in clinical trials.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 06:29:28 UTC (510 KB)"

In this study, we discuss important yet overlooked aspects of the near-field analysis. First, we experimentally demonstrate that the sample orientation inside the s-SNOM may significantly affect the near-field interference pattern of mid-infrared polaritons, leading to an error in momentum measurement up to 7.7% even for the modes with effective index of 12.5. Second, we establish a methodology to correctly extract the polariton damping rate from the interference fringes depending on their origin - the s-SNOM nano-tip or the material edge.

The distortion parameters, which satisfy the aesthetically appealing hypothesis, will likely aid in developing gravitational lensing theory.

However, the ill-posed nature of the fluid data completion problem makes it prohibitively difficult to obtain a theoretical solution and presents high numerical uncertainty and instability for a data-driven approach (e.g., a neural network model). To address these challenges, we leverage recent advancements in computer vision, employing the vector quantization technique to map both complete and incomplete fluid data spaces onto discrete-valued lower-dimensional representations via a two-stage learning procedure. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on Kolmogorov flow data (Reynolds number: 1000) occluded by masks of different size and arrangement.

Direct numerical simulations are performed using a one-way coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, with a fixed inner wall Reynolds number of 2500 for the carrier flow, while the particle Stokes number varies from 0.034 to 1 for the dispersed phase. We first examine the issue of preferential concentration of particles near the outer wall region. Employing two-dimensional (2D) Voronoi analysis, we observe a pronounced particle clustering with increasing $St$, particularly evident in regions of low fluid velocity. Additionally, we investigate the concentration balance equation, inspired by the work of johnson et al.(2020), to examine particle radial distribution. We discern the predominant sources of influence, namely biased sampling, turbophoresis, and centrifugal effects. Across all cases, centrifugal force emerges as the primary driver, causing particle migration towards the outer wall. Biased sampling predominantly affects smaller inertial particles, driving them towards the inner wall due to sampling within Taylor rolls with inward radial velocity. Conversely, turbophoresis primarily impacts larger inertial particles, inducing migration towards both walls where turbulent intensity is weaker compared to the bulk. With the revealed physics, our work provides a basis for predicting and controlling particle movement and distribution in industrial applications.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 02:29:45 UTC (3,561 KB)"

Very low-energy photons are blocked by the Pauli exclusion principle from participating in the inter-band process; however, they are permitted to participate in the intra-band process, with the band smeared by some impurity scattering. We establish a connection between the inter-band nonlinear optical conductivity in the velocity gauge and the shift vector in the length gauge for a two-band model. Using a quasiclassical kinetic approach, we demonstrate the importance of intra-band transitions in high harmonic generations for the single tilted Dirac cone model and hexagonal warping model.

"88",88,"Born's rule from epistemic assumptions","Per Östborn","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Born's rule is the recipe for calculating probabilities from quantum mechanical amplitudes. There is no generally accepted derivation of Born's rule from first principles. In this paper, it is motivated from assumptions that link the ontological content of a proper physical model to the epistemic conditions of the experimental context. More precisely, it is assumed that all knowable distinctions should correspond to distinctions in a proper model. This principle of ""ontological completeness"" means, for example, that the probabilistic treatment of the double slit experiment with and without path information should differ. Further, it is assumed that the model should rely only on knowable ontological elements, and that failure to fulfill this principle of ""ontological minimalism"" gives rise to wrong predictions. Consequently, probabilities should be assigned only to observable experimental outcomes. Also, the method to calculate such probabilities should not rely on the existence of a precise path of the observed object if this path is not knowable. A similar principle was promoted by Born, even though he did not apply it to probability. Another crucial assumption is that the proper rule to calculate probabilities should be generally valid. It should be applicable in all experimental contexts, regardless the setup that determines which attributes of the studied object are observed, together with the probability to observe each of the associated attribute values. There is no need to refer to the Hilbert space structure of quantum mechanics in the present treatment. Rather, some elements of this structure emerge from the analysis.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 23:03:37 UTC (112 KB)"

Klein","Space Physics (physics.space-ph)","Characterizing the thermodynamics of turbulent plasmas is key to decoding observable signatures from astrophysical systems. In magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, nonlinear interactions between counter-propagating Alfvén waves cascade energy to smaller spatial scales where dissipation heats the protons and electrons. When the thermal pressure far exceeds the magnetic pressure, linear theory predicts a spectral gap at perpendicular scales near the proton gyroradius where Alfvén waves become non-propagating. For simple models of an MHD turbulent cascade that assume only local nonlinear interactions, the cascade halts at this gap, preventing energy from reaching smaller scales where electron dissipation dominates, leading to an overestimate of the proton heating rate. In this work, we demonstrate that nonlocal contributions to the cascade, specifically large scale shearing and small scale diffusion, can bridge the non-propagating gap, allowing the cascade to continue to smaller scales. We provide an updated functional form for the proton-to-electron heating ratio accounting for this nonlocal energy transfer by evaluating a nonlocal weakened cascade model over a range of temperature and pressure ratios. In plasmas where the thermal pressure dominates the magnetic pressure, we observe that the proton heating is moderated compared to the significant enhancement predicted by local models.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 22:04:07 UTC (34,479 KB)"

In light of this, the present study aims to model the effect of climate change on the European electricity system, specifically on its long-term reliability. A resource adequate power system -- a system where electricity supply covers demand -- is sensitive to generation capacity, demand patterns, and the network structure and capacity. Climate change is foreseen to affect each of these components. In this analysis, we focused on two drivers of power system adequacy: the impact of temperature variations on electricity demand, and of water inflows changes on hydro generation. Using a post-processing approach, based on results found in the literature, the inputs of a large-scale electricity market model covering the European region were modified. The results show that climate change may decrease total LOLE (Loss of Load Expectation) hours in Europe by more than 50%, as demand will largely decrease because of a higher temperatures during winter. We found that the climate change impact on demand tends to decrease LOLE values, while the climate change effects on hydrological conditions tend to increase LOLE values. The study is built on a limited amount of open-source data and can flexibly incorporate various sets of assumptions. Outcomes also show the current difficulties to reliably model the effects of climate change on power system adequacy.

Mikhailov","Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)","As well known, magnetic fields in space are distributed very inhomogeneously. Some-times field distributions have forms of filaments with high magnetic field values. As many ob-servations show, such a filamentation takes place in convective cells in the Sun and other astro-physical objects. This effect is associated with the frozenness of the magnetic field into a medium with high conductivity that leads to compression of magnetic field lines and forming magnetic filaments. We show analytically, based on the general analysis, that the magnetic field intensifies in the regions of downward flows in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional convective cells. These regions of the hyperbolic type for magnetic fields play a role of a specific attractor. This analysis was confirmed by numerical simulations for 2D convective cells of the roll-type. Without dissipation the magnetic field grows exponentially in time and does not depend on the aspect ratio between horizontal and vertical scale of the cell. An increase due to compression in the magnetic field in the high conductive plasma is saturated due to the natural limitation associated with dissipative effects when the maximum magnitude of the magnetic field is of the order of the root of the magnetic Reynolds number Rem. For the solar convective zone the mean kinetic energy density exceeds mean magnetic energy density at least for two orders of magnitude that allows one to use the kinematic approximation for the MHD induction equation. In this paper based on the stability analysis we explain why downward flows influence magnetic filaments from making them more flat with orientation along interfaces between convective cells.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 19:48:38 UTC (895 KB)"
"99",99,"New Prospects for a Causally Local Formulation of Quantum Theory","Jacob A. Barandes","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","It is difficult to extract reliable criteria for causal locality from the limited ingredients found in textbook quantum theory. In the end, Bell humbly warned that his eponymous theorem was based on criteria that ""should be viewed with the utmost suspicion."" Remarkably, by stepping outside the wave-function paradigm, one can reformulate quantum theory in terms of old-fashioned configuration spaces together with 'unistochastic' laws. These unistochastic laws take the form of directed conditional probabilities, which turn out to provide a hospitable foundation for encoding microphysical causal relationships. This unistochastic reformulation provides quantum theory with a simpler and more transparent axiomatic foundation, plausibly resolves the measurement problem, and deflates various exotic claims about superposition, interference, and entanglement. Making use of this reformulation, this paper introduces a new principle of causal locality that is intended to improve on Bell's criteria, and shows directly that systems that remain at spacelike separation cannot exert causal influences on each other, according to that new principle. These results therefore lead to a general hidden-variables interpretation of quantum theory that is arguably compatible with causal locality.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 18:19:51 UTC (73 KB)"

The novelty of this study is based on the combina-tion of argon plasma exposure of micropatterned PDMS scaffold, where the plasma served as a strong tool for subsequent grafting of collagen coating and their application as cell growth scaf-folds, where the standard has been significantly exceeded. As part of scaffold design, templates with a patterned microstructure of different dimensions (50 x 50, 50 x 20 and 30 x 30 microns were created by photolithography followed by pattern replication on a PDMS polymer substrate. Subsequently, the prepared microstructured PDMS replicas were coated with a type I collagen layer. The sample preparation was followed by the characterization of material surface properties through various analytical techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). To evaluate the biocompatibility of the produced samples, we conducted studies on the interactions between selected polymer replicas with micro- and nanostructures and mammalian cells. Specif-ically, we utilized mouse myoblasts (C2C12) and our results demonstrate that we achieved excellent cell alignment in conjunction with the development of a cytocompatible surface. Consequently, the outcomes of this research contribute to an enhanced comprehension of surface properties and interactions between structured polymers and mammalian cells. The use of periodic microstructures holds the potential for advancing the creation of novel materials and scaffolds in tissue engineering. These materials exhibit exceptional biocompatibility and possess the capacity to promote cell adhesion and growth.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 15:33:48 UTC (1,502 KB)"

Despite the significant progress in the accuracy and diversity of solutions, existing IMD methods lag behind in terms of trustworthiness. The root issue is that the design process of these methods is increasingly more implicit and indirect, and this process is also isolated from the native forward process (NFP), the ground-truth function that models the molecular dynamics. Following this insight, we propose TrustMol, an IMD method built to be trustworthy. For this purpose, TrustMol relies on a set of technical novelties including a new variational autoencoder network. Moreover, we propose a latent-property pairs acquisition method to effectively navigate the complexities of molecular latent optimization, a process that seems intuitive yet challenging due to the high-frequency and discontinuous nature of molecule space. TrustMol also integrates uncertainty-awareness into molecular latent optimization. These lead to improvements in both explainability and reliability of the IMD process. We validate the trustworthiness of TrustMol through a wide range of experiments.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 15:14:38 UTC (734 KB)"

Applying single-spacecraft interferometry to several hundred solitary waves collected in about two minute intervals, we show that almost all of them have the electrostatic potential of positive polarity and propagate quasi-parallel to the local magnetic field with plasma frame velocities of the order of 100 km/s. The solitary waves have typical parallel half-widths from 10 to 100 m that is between 1 and 10 Debye lengths and typical amplitudes of the electrostatic potential from 10 to 200 mV that is between 0.01 and 1% of local electron temperature. The solitary waves are associated with quasi-Maxwellian ion velocity distribution functions, and their plasma frame velocities are comparable with ion thermal speed and well below electron thermal speed. We argue that the solitary waves of positive polarity are slow electron holes and estimate the time scale of their acceleration, which occurs due to interaction with ions, to be of the order of one second. The observation of slow electron holes indicates that their lifetime was shorter than the acceleration time scale. We argue that multi-spacecraft interferometry applied previously to these solitary waves is not applicable because of their too-short spatial scales. The source of the slow electron holes and the role in electron-ion energy exchange remain to be established.","Sun, 25 Feb 2024 21:19:04 UTC (20,458 KB)"

This way, we are able to identify a relatively small sub-ensemble of sequences responsible for long-lived excited states, high average charge separation, and high dipole moment. Further analysis shows that these sequences are particularly T-rich. By systematically screening the impact of electron-hole interaction (Coulomb forces), we verify that these correlations are relatively robust against finite-size variations of the interaction parameter, not directly accessible experimentally.

A particularly challenging task is the forecasting of timeseries generated by chaotic dynamics. In recent years reservoir computing has been shown to be an effective method of forecasting chaotic dynamics and reconstructing chaotic attractors from data. In this work strides are made toward smaller and lower complexity reservoirs with the goal of improved hardware implementability and more reliable production of adequate surrogate models. We show that a reservoir of uncoupled nodes more reliably produces long term timeseries predictions than complex reservoir topologies. We then link the improved attractor reconstruction of the uncoupled reservoir with smaller spectral radii of the resulting surrogate systems. These results indicate that, the node degree plays an important role in determining whether the desired dynamics will be stable in the autonomous surrogate system which is attained via closed-loop operation of the trained reservoir. In terms of hardware implementability, uncoupled nodes would allow for greater freedom in the hardware architecture because no complex coupling setups are needed and because, for uncoupled nodes, the system response is equivalent for space and time multiplexing.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 09:43:52 UTC (7,225 KB)"

Considering the first strategy, we obtain an expression for the basic reproduction number and infer a minimum vaccination rate necessary to ensure the stability of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) solution. In the second strategy, the short duration pulses are added to a constant baseline vaccination rate. The pulse is applied according to the seasonal forcing phases. The best outcome is obtained by locating the intensive immunization at inflection of the transmissivity curve. There, a vaccination rate of $44.4%$ of susceptible individuals is enough to ensure DFE. For the third vaccination proposal, additionally to the amplitude, the pulses have a prolonged time width. We obtain a non-linear relationship between vaccination rates and the duration of the campaign. Our simulations show that the baseline rates, as well as the pulse duration, can substantially improve the vaccination campaign effectiveness. These findings are in agreement with our analytical expression. We show a relationship between the vaccination parameters and the accumulated number of infected individuals, over the years and show the relevance of the immunisation campaign annual reaching for controlling the infection spreading. Regarding the dynamical behaviour of the model, our simulations shows that chaotic and periodic solutions, as well as bi-stable regions, depend on the vaccination parameters range.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 09:29:49 UTC (3,393 KB)"

The concept of broadly pre-training neural networks has advanced fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and protein engineering. However, similar approaches for small organic molecules have not achieved comparable success. In this work, we introduce a novel pre-training strategy, substrate scope contrastive learning, which learns atomic representations tailored to chemical reactivity. This method considers the grouping of substrates and their yields in published substrate scope tables as a measure of their similarity or dissimilarity in terms of chemical reactivity. We focus on 20,798 aryl halides in the CAS Content Collection spanning thousands of publications to learn a representation of aryl halide reactivity. We validate our pre-training approach through both intuitive visualizations and comparisons to traditional reactivity descriptors and physical organic chemistry principles. The versatility of these embeddings is further evidenced in their application to yield prediction, regioselectivity prediction, and the diverse selection of new substrates.

Here, we analyze the extent to which different intramolecular donor-acceptor vibrational frequencies affect excitation energy transport in equilibrium (coherent light excitation) and the more natural nonequilibrium steady state (incoherent light excitation) configurations. It is found that if the Huang-Rhys factors remain constant, the acceptor population increases when the intramolecular vibrational frequency of the acceptor exceeds that of the donor. The increase in the acceptor population due to the vibrational frequency difference is higher for higher values of the Huang-Rhys factors or the vibronic coupling strengths.

As a substantial contribution towards its solution, we show that the total orbital correlation actually reveals and quantifies the intrinsic complexity of the wavefunction,once it is minimized via orbital rotations. To demonstrate the power of this concept in practice, an iterative scheme is proposed to optimize the orbitals by minimizing the total orbital correlation calculated by the tailored coupled cluster singles and doubles (TCCSD) ansatz. The optimized orbitals enable the limited TCCSD ansatz to capture more non-trivial information of the many-body wavefunction, indicated by the improved wavefunction and energy. An initial application of this scheme shows great improvement of TCCSD in predicting the singlet ground state potential energy curves of the strongly correlated C$_{m 2}$ and Cr$_{m 2}$ molecule.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 18:59:08 UTC (1,527 KB)"

The setting presented here can be implemented in nonlinear optical waveguides emulating the fractional diffraction. Systematic consideration identifies parameters of moving fundamental and vortex solitons (with vorticities 0 and 1 or 2, respectively) and maximum velocities up to which stable solitons persist, for characteristic values of the Levy index which determines the fractionality of the underlying model. Outcomes of collisions between 2D solitons moving in opposite directions are identified too.

However, the microscopic pathways between non-equilibrium, non-diffusive amorphous (glassy) phases still remain poorly understood. In this work, we have employed computer simulations, persistence homology (a tool rooted in topological data analysis), and machine learning to probe the microscopic pathway of pressure-induced non-equilibrium transition between the low- and high-density amorphous (LDA and HDA, respectively) ice phases of TIP4P/2005 and ST2 water models. Using persistence homology and machine learning, we introduced a new order parameter that unambiguously identifies the LDA and HDA-like local environments. The system transitions continuously and collectively in the order parameter space via a pre-ordered intermediate phase during the compression of the LDA phase. The local order parameter susceptibilities show a maximum near the transition pressure ($P^*$) -- suggesting maximum structural heterogeneities near $P^*$. The HDA-like clusters are structurally ramified and spatially delocalized inside the LDA phase near the transition pressure. We have further investigated the (geometrical) structures and topologies of the LDA and HDA ices formed via different protocols and also studied the dependence of the microscopic pathway of phase transition in the order parameter space on the protocol followed to prepare the initial LDA phase. Finally, the method adopted here to study the microscopic pathways of transition is not restricted to the system under consideration and provides a robust way of probing phase transition pathways involving any two condensed phases at both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium conditions.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 17:28:31 UTC (20,239 KB)"

In most of them, the random thermal motion of the particles is considered detrimental as it is responsible for decoherence and noise. In conditions of diffusive propagation, thermal atoms can potentially occupy various stable spatial modes in a glass cell. Extended or localized, diffusive modes have different magnetic properties, depending on the boundary conditions of the atomic cell, and can react differently to external perturbations. Here we demonstrate that few of these modes can be selectively excited, manipulated, and interrogated in atomic thermal vapours using laser light. In particular, we individuate the conditions for the generation of modes that are exceptionally resilient to undesirable effects introduced by optical pumping, such as light shifts and power-broadening, which are often the dominant sources of systematic errors in atomic magnetometers and co-magnetometers. Moreover, we show that the presence of spatial inhomogeneity in the pump, on top of the random diffusive atomic motion, introduces a coupling that leads to a coherent exchange of excitation between the two longest-lived modes. Our results indicate that systematic engineering of the multi-mode nature of diffusive gases has great potential for improving the performance of quantum technology applications based on alkali-metal thermal gases, and promote these simple experimental systems as versatile tools for quantum information applications.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 17:16:16 UTC (4,894 KB)"

This reduces the dimension of the original 4-dimensional HH model, decreasing the complexity of the model equations. With a new reduced 2-dimensional HH-type model equations, we have derived the main properties of the propagation speed and width of action potentials for axons with the ATP Na-K pumps as a function of the transmembrane capacity $C_m$ and resistivity $R$ of the gap junctions connecting the Schwann cells of the axon. We show that the action potential propagates along the axon with speed well described by $v(R, C_m)=alpha /({C_m R^{eta}})$, where $alpha $ and $eta <1$ are constants independent of the intensity stimulus of the soma. If a current stimulus is introduced at the axon, away from the soma and with an intensity above threshold, two action potential signals propagate in opposite directions of the axon, annihilating the action potential arriving from the soma.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 16:30:23 UTC (7,351 KB)[v2] Tue, 27 Feb 2024 10:15:21 UTC (7,355 KB)"

Röpke","Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)","High-order Godunov methods for gas dynamics have become a standard tool for simulating different classes of astrophysical flows. Their accuracy is mostly determined by the spatial interpolant used to reconstruct the pair of Riemann states at cell interfaces and by the Riemann solver that computes the interface fluxes. In most Godunov-type methods, these two steps can be treated independently, so that many different schemes can in principle be built from the same numerical framework. In this work, we use our fully compressible Seven-League Hydro (SLH) code to test the accuracy of six reconstruction methods and three approximate Riemann solvers on two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) problems involving subsonic flows only. We consider Mach numbers in the range from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-1}$ in a well-posed, 2D, Kelvin--Helmholtz instability problem and a 3D turbulent convection zone that excites internal gravity waves in an overlying stable layer. We find that (i) there is a spread of almost four orders of magnitude in computational cost per fixed accuracy between the methods tested in this study, with the most performant method being a combination of a ""low-dissipation"" Riemann solver and a sextic reconstruction scheme, (ii) the low-dissipation solver always outperforms conventional Riemann solvers on a fixed grid when the reconstruction scheme is kept the same, (iii) in simulations of turbulent flows, increasing the order of spatial reconstruction reduces the characteristic dissipation length scale achieved on a given grid even if the overall scheme is only second order accurate, (iv) reconstruction methods based on slope-limiting techniques tend to generate artificial, high-frequency acoustic waves during the evolution of the flow, (v) unlimited reconstruction methods introduce oscillations in the thermal stratification near the convective boundary, where the entropy gradient is steep.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 16:24:39 UTC (25,342 KB)"

Komacek","Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)","Tropical cyclones occur over the Earth's tropical oceans, with characteristic genesis regions and tracks tied to the warm ocean surface that provides energy to sustain these storms. The study of tropical cyclogenesis and evolution on Earth has led to the development of environmental favorability metrics that predict the strength of potential storms from the local background climate state. Simulations of the gamut of transiting terrestrial exoplanets orbiting late-type stars may offer a test of this Earth-based understanding of tropical cyclogenesis. Previous work has demonstrated that tropical cyclones are likely to form on tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets with intermediate rotation periods of $sim 8-10~mathrm{days}$. In this study, we test these expectations using ExoCAM simulations with both a sufficient horizontal resolution of 0.47$^circ$ x 0.63$^circ$ required to permit tropical cyclogenesis along with a thermodynamically active slab ocean. We conduct simulations of tidally locked and ocean-covered Earth-sized planets orbiting late-type M dwarf stars with varying rotation periods from 4-16 days in order to cross the predicted maximum in tropical cyclogenesis. We track tropical cyclones that form in each simulation and assess their location of maximum wind, evolution, and maximum wind speeds. We compare the resulting tropical cyclone locations and strengths to predictions based on environmental favorability metrics, finding good agreement between the Earth-based metrics and our simulated storms with a local maximum in both tropical cyclone frequency and intensity at a rotation period of 8 days. Our results suggest that environmental favorability metrics used for tropical cyclones on Earth may also be applicable to temperate tidally locked Earth-sized rocky exoplanets with abundant surface liquid water.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 16:04:24 UTC (5,813 KB)"

CLB shows excellent convergence properties, but it is plagued by nonlocality which results in an exponential depth of the corresponding circuit with the number of Carleman variables. The CNS offers a dramatic reduction of the number Carleman variables, which might lead to a viable depth, provided locality can be preserved and convergence can be achieved with a moderate number of iterates also at sizeable Reynolds numbers. Finally it is argued that CG might combine the best of CLB and CNS.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 16:04:12 UTC (607 KB)"

One path to achieving noise resilience in hybrid quantum algorithms is to decrease the required circuit depth -- the number of applied gates -- to solve a given problem. This work demonstrates how to reduce circuit depth by combining the transcorrelated (TC) approach with adaptive quantum ansätze and their implementations in the context of variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE). The combined TC-AVQITE method is used to calculate ground state energies across the potential energy surfaces of H$_4$, LiH, and H$_2$O. In particular, H$_4$ is a notoriously difficult case where unitary coupled cluster theory, including singles and doubles excitations, fails to provide accurate results. Adding TC yields energies close to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while reducing the number of necessary operators -- and thus circuit depth -- in the adaptive ansätze. The reduced circuit depth furthermore makes our algorithm more noise-resilient and accelerates convergence. Our study demonstrates that combining the TC method with adaptive ansätze yields compact, noise-resilient, and easy-to-optimize quantum circuits that yield accurate quantum chemistry results close to the CBS limit.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 15:31:56 UTC (726 KB)"

Temmer","Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)","This study covers a thorough statistical investigation of the evolution of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) with and without sheaths, through a broad heliocentric distance and temporal range. The analysis treats the sheath and magnetic obstacle (MO) separately to gain more insight about their physical properties. In detail, we aim to unravel different characteristics of these structures occurring over the inner and outer heliosphere. The method is based on a large statistical sample of ICMEs probed over different distances in the heliosphere. For this, information about detection times for sheath and MO from 13 individual ICME catalogs were collected and cross-checked. The time information was then combined into a main catalog used as basis for the statistical investigation. The data analysis based on that covers a wealth of spacecraft missions enabling in-situ solar wind measurements from 1975--2022. This allows to study differences between solar cycles. All the structures under study (sheath, MO with and without sheath) show the biggest increase in size together with the largest decrease in density at a distance 0.75 AU. At 1 AU we find different sizes for MOs with and without sheath, with the former being larger. Up to 1 AU, the upstream solar wind shows the strongest pile-up close to the interface with the sheath. For larger distances the pile-up region seems to shift and recedes from that interface further into the upstream solar wind. This might refer to a change in the sheath formation mechanism (driven versus non-driven) with heliocentric distance, suggesting the relevance of the CME propagation and expansion behavior in the outer heliosphere. Comparison to previous studies shows inconsistencies over the solar cycle, which makes more detailed studies necessary to fully understand the evolution of ICME structures.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 15:25:59 UTC (12,388 KB)"

With an intense, red-detuned pump pulse, we generate a high density of virtual excitons or exciton--polarons in various moiré minibands. A broadband probe pulse in turn measures the response of all optical resonances induced by the pump-generated excitations. We generically observe a coherent blue shift originating from contact-like exciton--exciton interactions. At charge neutrality, these measurements allow us to assess the spatial overlap between different optical excitations: in particular, we observe signatures of a bound biexciton state between two different moire exciton modes. For integer fillings $
u=2$ and $
u=3$ of the moiré lattice with electrons, the correlated Mott state results in a suppression of the exciton--polaron interactions, providing a nonlinear optical signature of electronic incompressibility. In stark contrast, for lower electron fillings $
u < 2$, the light shift of the attractive polaron resonance is electron density independent. Deeply localized moiré polarons are thus akin to an ensemble of non-interacting two-level atoms, subject to the single-emitter ac Stark effect. Finally, tuning the pump laser on resonance with the attractive polaron for $
u < 2$, we demonstrate the filling of the moiré lattice with localized polarons and thereby realize a nonequilibrium Bose--Fermi mixture in moiré flat bands.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 15:02:51 UTC (1,315 KB)"

Uncertainty estimation is essential to quantify this error, and make application of data-centric approaches more trustworthy. To ensure that uncertainty quantification is used widely, one should aim for algorithms that are reasonably accurate, but also easy to implement and apply. In particular, including uncertainty quantification on top of an existing architecture should be straightforward, and add minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, it should be easy to manipulate or combine multiple machine-learning predictions, propagating uncertainty over further modeling steps. We compare several well-established uncertainty quantification frameworks against these requirements, and propose a practical approach, which we dub direct propagation of shallow ensembles, that provides a good compromise between ease of use and accuracy. We present benchmarks for generic datasets, and an in-depth study of applications to the field of atomistic machine learning for chemistry and materials. These examples underscore the importance of using a formulation that allows propagating errors without making strong assumptions on the correlations between different predictions of the model.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 14:51:36 UTC (1,080 KB)"

Fitzgerald (2), David ","Image and Video Processing (eess.IV)","Introduction: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has become a standard treatment for early-stage lung cancer. However, the heterogeneous response to radiation at the tumor level poses challenges. Currently, standardized dosage regimens lack adaptation based on individual patient or tumor characteristics. Thus, we explore the potential of delta radiomics from on-treatment magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to track radiation dose response, inform personalized radiotherapy dosing, and predict outcomes. Methods: A retrospective study of 47 MR-guided lung SBRT treatments for 39 patients was conducted. Radiomic features were extracted using Pyradiomics, and stability was evaluated temporally and spatially. Delta radiomics were correlated with radiation dose delivery and assessed for associations with tumor control and survival with Cox regressions. Results: Among 107 features, 49 demonstrated temporal stability, and 57 showed spatial stability. Fifteen stable and non-collinear features were analyzed. Median Skewness and surface to volume ratio decreased with radiation dose fraction delivery, while coarseness and 90th percentile values increased. Skewness had the largest relative median absolute changes (22%-45%) per fraction from baseline and was associated with locoregional failure (p=0.012) by analysis of covariance. Skewness, Elongation, and Flatness were significantly associated with local recurrence-free survival, while tumor diameter and volume were not. Conclusions: Our study establishes the feasibility and stability of delta radiomics analysis for MR-guided lung SBRT. Findings suggest that MR delta radiomics can capture short-term radiographic manifestations of intra-tumoral radiation effect.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:00:44 UTC (1,966 KB)"

However, available models fail to fully capture the physics of turbulent mixing when buoyancy becomes predominant with respect to momentum. Therefore, high-fidelity experiments of well-controlled fundamental flows are needed to develop and validate more accurate models. We analyze experiments of positive and negative turbulent buoyant jets, both in uniform and stratified environments, with the aim of understanding the thermal hydraulics of turbulent mixing with variable density and providing high-fidelity data for the development and validation of turbulence models. Non-intrusive, simultaneous Particle Image Velocimetry and Laser Induced Fluorescence measurements were carried out to acquire instantaneous velocity and concentration fields on a vertical section parallel to the axis of a jet in the self-similar region. The Refractive Index Matching method was applied to measure high-resolution buoyant jets with up to 8.6% density difference. These data are free of the typical errors that characterize optical measurements of buoyancy driven flows (e.g., natural and mixed convection) where the refractive index of the fluid is inhomogeneous throughout the measurement domain. Turbulent statistics and entrainment of buoyant jets in uniform and stratified environments are presented. These data are compared with non-buoyant jets in uniform environment, as a reference to investigate the effects of buoyancy and stratification on turbulent mixing. The results will be used for the assessment of current turbulence models and as basis for the development of a new one that captures turbulent mixing.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 14:41:09 UTC (1,100 KB)"

Reading of the array is not done on a single-pixel basis, but all pixels are read simultaneously. Because of thermal agitation and other phenomena, each pixel can fire even in the dark with a small but not zero probability of adding to the output signal a fixed current. Each pixel has an average random event rate, and the dark noise rate is due to the sum of any pixel contribution. Statistically, two or more pixels may fire simultaneously, giving a current signal equal to the sum of the pixels involved. This eventuality has a lower probability of a more significant number of fired pixels.

In electronic structure calculations, excited states typically correspond to saddle points on the surface described by the variation of the energy as a function of the electronic degrees of freedom. A direct optimization algorithm based on generalized mode following is presented for density functional calculations of excited states. While conventional direct optimization methods based on quasi-Newton algorithms usually converge to the stationary point closest to the initial guess, even minima, the generalized mode following approach systematically targets a saddle point of a specific order l by following the l lowest eigenvectors of the electronic Hessian up in energy. This approach thereby recasts the challenging saddle point search as a minimization, enabling the use of efficient and robust minimization algorithms. The initial guess orbitals and the saddle point order of the target excited state solution are evaluated by performing an initial step of constrained optimization freezing the electronic degrees of freedom involved in the excitation. In the context of Kohn-Sham density functional calculations, typical approximations to the exchange-and-correlation functional suffer from a self-interaction error. The Perdew and Zunger self-interaction correction can alleviate this problem, but makes the energy variant to unitary transformations in the occupied orbital space, introducing a large amount of unphysical solutions that do not fully minimize the self-interaction error. An extension of the generalized mode following method is proposed that ensures convergence to the solution minimizing the self-interaction error.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 14:30:34 UTC (7,787 KB)"

It is therefore not clear whether this new indicator will still be helpful in a more realistic setting. Secondly, the statistical methods employed in the simulation work only for time series that are much longer than the currently available historical series. As not much can be done in the short term about the first issue, this paper focuses on the second issue.

While reinforcement learning has been applied successfully in a number of rather simple flow control benchmarks, a major bottleneck toward real-world applications is the high computational cost and turnaround time of flow simulations. In this contribution, we demonstrate the benefits of model-based reinforcement learning for flow control applications. Specifically, we optimize the policy by alternating between trajectories sampled from flow simulations and trajectories sampled from an ensemble of environment models. The model-based learning reduces the overall training time by up to $85%$ for the fluidic pinball test case.

Understanding how their growth responds to climatic changes is crucial for accurately quantifying climate and weather in the extratropics. To date, quantitative climatic measures of storms' growth have been mostly based on Eulerian measures, taking into account the mean state of the atmosphere and how those affect eddy growth, but they do not consider the Lagrangian growth of the storms themselves. Here, using ERA-5 reanalysis data and tracking all extratropical storms (cyclones and anticyclones) from over 80 years of data, we examine the actual growth of the storms and compare it to the Eulerian characteristics of the mean state as the storms develop. We find that, in the limit of weak baroclinicity, measures such as the Eulerian Eady Growth Rate provide a good measure of the storms' actual strength. However, for high baroclinicity levels, this linear relationship breaks. We show that while the actual growth rate of single storms is linearly correlated with the Eulerian measures, the high baroclinicity reduction in storm strength is due to a decrease in the storms' growth time with baroclinicity. Based on the Lagrangian analysis, we suggest a nonlinear correction to the traditional Eady Growth Rate. Expanding the analysis to include the mean flow's barotropic properties highlights their marginal effect on storms' growth rate but the crucial impact on growth time. Our results emphasize the potential of Lagrangianly studying many storms to advance understanding of the midlatitude climate.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 12:15:50 UTC (827 KB)"

Micro particle tracking velocimetry (micro PTV) experiments and modeling show that near ideal plug flow is possible in such liquid-in-liquid channels due to the reduced friction at the walls. The measured fluids velocity profiles agree with the predictions of a hydrodynamic model of cylindrical symmetry with a minimal set of hypotheses. By introducing symmetry breaking elements in the system, we show how unique velocity and flow properties can be obtained. Our liquid-in-liquid confinement opens new possibilities for < 10 micrometer-sized microfluidics with low pressures and low shear, with flow characteristics not attainable in comparable solid-wall devices.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 11:46:17 UTC (1,226 KB)"

The cluster counting method, which measures the number of primary ionizations in gaseous detectors, represents a promising breakthrough in PID. However, developing an effective reconstruction algorithm for cluster counting remains a major challenge. In this study, we address this challenge by proposing a cluster counting algorithm based on long short-term memory and dynamic graph convolutional neural networks. Leveraging Monte Carlo simulated samples, our machine learning-based algorithm surpasses traditional methods. Specifically, it achieves a remarkable 10% improvement in $K/pi$ separation for PID performance.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 11:23:42 UTC (198 KB)"
"150",150,"An efficient multimode vectorial nonlinear propagation solver beyond the weak guidance approximation","Pierre Béjot","Optics (physics.optics)","In this article, we present an efficient numerical model able to solve the vectorial nonlinear pulse propagation equation in circularly symmetric multimode waveguides. The algorithm takes advantage of the conservation of total angular momentum of light upon propagation and takes into account the vectorial nature of the propagating modes, making it particularly relevant for studies in ring-core fibers. While conventional propagation solvers exhibit a computational complexity scaling as N^4_{mode} where N_{mode} is the number of considered modes, the present solver scales as N^{3/2}_{mode}. As a first example, it is shown that orbital angular momentum modulation instability processes take place in ring-core fibers in realistic conditions. Finally, it is predicted that the modulation instability process is followed by the appearance of breather-like angular structures.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 11:18:10 UTC (19,423 KB)"
