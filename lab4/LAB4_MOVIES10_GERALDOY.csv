"2","Grave of the Fireflies","ADI-0004","4 June 2022","8/10","War is Evil","Grave of the Fireflies is a powerful animated war drama which highlights the destruction and devastation caused on public property and the economy by showing the lives of two siblings Seita and his younger sister Setsuko. Their tale of
survival is as heartbreaking as it is true to life. The siblings rely completely on each other and struggle against all odds to stay together and stay alive.I loved how the movie didnt focus on fighting and
violence at all but directly went into the impact the war has on everyday life. Thus the politics of war was avoided The movie has a slow but steady pace throughout and all the emotions are very well portrayed through the expressions the background music and of course the voice acting"

"11","Puss in Boots","lojitsu","5 April 2023","8/10","Like Zorro and Pirated of the Caribbean had a cartoon baby.","Heres The 4K Lowedown on Puss in Boots: The Last Wish(PG - 2022 - Blu)Genre: AnimatedFamilyMy Score: 7.9Cast10 Acting7 Plot=8 Ending=8 Story=8 Art8 Voice9 Music5 Family9 Funny7When Puss discovers that he has burned through eight of his nine lives, he launches an epic journey to restore them by finding the mythical Last Wish.I know I can never defeat you, Lobo...but I will never stop fighting for this life.I liked this...it felt like Zorro and Pirates of the Caribbean had a cartoon baby. The artwork was done two different ways...one being your conventional DreamWorks stuff and when the fight scenes started it was all of a sudden Into the Spiderverse. This film from the Shrek franchise is worth a watch for sure."
